### patient can log in to the client site to request an appointment for medical analysis by (CARDIOLOGY REQUISITION) Form, patient chooses any hospital from those that existed in the DB and specify some date and time to go to this hospital to make the required analysis.
### After the patient go to this hospital and make the required analysis, the hospital can upload the result of these analyses which is a 17 input as specified in the (Upload) Form which we can call (Medical Reports)
### these Medical Reports are automatically taken by the API of the AI model and resulting a percentage, this percentage represents the possibility of heart failure for this patient and  is stored in the Medical Records table for this patient and so on for any other patient 
### Admin can log in at the admin dashboard to specify a date and time for every patient based on the highest percentage which means the highest priority
